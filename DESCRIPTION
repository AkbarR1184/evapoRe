Description: The evapoRe package provides convenient access to diverse global evapotranspiration (ET) datasets. 
  It enables users to download, validate, visualize, and analyze multi-source ET data across various spatiotemporal scales.
  The package offers calculation methods for estimating potential ET (PET), including temperature-based and radiation-based approaches.
  EvapoRe supports hydrological modeling, climate studies, agricultural research, and other data-driven fields by facilitating access to ET data and offering powerful analysis capabilities.
  Users can seamlessly integrate the package into their research applications and explore diverse ET data at different resolutions.
